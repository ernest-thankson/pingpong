GENERAL INFO
This was the first programming project I worked on. It was done in a team of three for our Introduction to Programming for Engineering course.In terms of my individual contribution, I wrote most of the code. It was written in Python.

PROJECT INFO
The game is a ping pong game that uses the turtle module in Python for its graphics. This is generally not a module one might use for such a project but we thought we would try it out. The player can only move left and right using the right and left arrow keys. The ball bounces of the player when the come into contact.
